          <h3 class="toggle-heading">Early Animation Devices (Pre-1900s)</h3>
          <p class="toggle-content hidden">In this era, animation was in its most primitive form, characterized by mechanical devices like the <b>zoetrope</b>, <b>phenakistoscope</b>, and <b>praxinoscope</b>. These inventions relied on sequential images to create the illusion of motion when spun or rotated. Animation at this stage was not yet tied to storytelling but rather to scientific curiosity and entertainment. Improvements came with the realization of how persistence of vision could simulate movement, laying the foundation for later cinematic breakthroughs. Key examples include early optical toys and devices that fascinated audiences by bringing static images to life, marking the very beginning of animated motion.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <h3 class="toggle-heading">Silent Era (1900-1920s)</h3>
          <p class="toggle-content hidden">The silent era saw animation emerge as a recognized medium for storytelling and artistic experimentation. This period was defined by painstakingly hand-drawn films, often created by a single animator. A landmark work of the time was Winsor McCay’s <b>"Gertie the Dinosaur"</b> (1914), which introduced character-driven animation and interactivity, as McCay performed live alongside Gertie. Another notable work was Stuart Blackton’s <b>"Humorous Phases of Funny Faces"</b> (1906), often credited as the first animated film. The era’s major improvement was the development of cel animation, which streamlined production by allowing animators to separate character movements from static backgrounds, reducing workload and enabling more complex stories.</p>

          <h3 class="toggle-heading">Golden Age of Animation (1930s-1950s)</h3>
          <p class="toggle-content hidden">The Golden Age was marked by the rise of major studios like Walt Disney Productions, Warner Bros., and MGM, which shaped animation into a mainstream art form. Walt Disney’s <b>"Steamboat Willie"</b> (1928) introduced synchronized sound, revolutionizing the medium and popularizing Mickey Mouse. This era reached its pinnacle with <b>"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"</b> (1937), the first full-length animated feature film, which blended compelling storytelling, rich characters, and innovative use of technicolor. Warner Bros. countered with shorts featuring now-iconic characters like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, characterized by fast-paced humor and clever dialogue. The era’s advancements included the use of vibrant colors, synchronized soundtracks, and sophisticated character animation, establishing animation as a serious medium in cinema.</p>

          <h3 class="toggle-heading">Post-War Era and Television Animation (1950s-1970s)</h3>
          <p class="toggle-content hidden">With the advent of television, animation shifted towards shorter, cost-effective formats tailored for home viewing. Shows like <b>"The Flintstones"</b> (1960) and <b>"Scooby-Doo"</b> (1969) brought animation into living rooms, emphasizing humor and relatability. Meanwhile, Japan’s animation industry, led by Osamu Tezuka’s <b>"Astro Boy"</b> (1963), introduced serialized storytelling and unique artistic styles, laying the groundwork for the global popularity of anime. This period also saw the rise of limited animation techniques, which reused frames and backgrounds to lower costs while maintaining visual appeal. Despite these constraints, the era produced beloved characters and long-lasting series that left a cultural impact.</p>
